# Guragura

This repository provides a simple game where the player uses the left and right arrow keys. The goal of the game is to reach the goal (a static element on the screen) as many times as possible before the time runs out. Each time the goal is reached, the player gains points, and the game difficulty increases. The player can overlap with the goal if a certain overlap threshold is met. Just made this for learning how to Svelte, powered by [`create-svelte`](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/tree/master/packages/create-svelte).


## Developing

```bash
npm run dev
```

## Building

To create a production version of your app:

```bash
npm run build
```

You can preview the production build with `npm run preview`.

## Deploy to GitHub Pages
To deploy a static page of the app:
